run `npx sequelize init`
this will use .sequelizerc to make the folders in this folder and a new config folder
change the dialect in the config file to 'postgres'
this path will be in .gitignore, so orgnaize it how you want

then run `createuser <username>`
then run `createdb <database-name> -O <username>`

the models are already made, run `npx sequelize db:migrate` which will translate the migrations into tables in the database
when editing the models, also edit the migrations, make sure they're consistent.

For dummy data, add stuff in seeders/ with `npx sequelize seed:generate --name <table-name>` and then run `npx sequelize db:seed:all`

if you mess something up just purge the database :)

For the command-line interface for postgres,
/h for SQL commands and /? for psql commands
